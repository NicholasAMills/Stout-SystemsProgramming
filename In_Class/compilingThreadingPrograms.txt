***How to compile C/C++ programs with std::thread and openMP in Linux.

To compile programs with std::thread support, please use:

g++ -std=c++11 prog1.cpp -lpthread -o prog1g

For openMP support, please use:

 g++ -fopenmp prog1.cpp -o prog1

For programs that use both (std::thread and openMP pragmas):

g++ -std=c++11 prog1.cpp -lpthread -o prog1 -fopenmp
